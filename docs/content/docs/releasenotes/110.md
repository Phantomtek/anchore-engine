## Anchore Engine 1.1.0

API version - 0.1.20

DB Schema version - 0.0.16

### Rocky Linux support

Anchore Enterprise can now scan Rocky Linux images for vulnerabilities. 

### Fixes
 
- Images that had Go content and hints enabled were failing analysis. This has been fixed.
- Inventory images were failing to parse properly, which caused scan failures. This issue has been fixed.
- With the Grype provider, NVD and vendor CVSS scores were missing for records in non-NVD namespaces. This is now fixed.
